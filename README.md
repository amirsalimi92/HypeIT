I tried to learn the logic of Django and work with data in the database.
Also, it helped me to have a good view of MVC frameworks.

In this project, I used the ready templates for the front end and I just changed them.

My point for this project was to have a management system to organize the process of ordering new devices in an IT team, 
ready the devices for staff, and inventory.

In addition, I learned about mail servers and connect my app to a mail to send automatically the email to registered staff.

Of course, the database was the most important thing in this project and I learned a lot about it and could use practically, 
the query that I learned at the university to select some data, mix them or join tables, etc to send them to show in the front end.

after this project, I can say, now I have a really better look at OOP and using the classes and functions.


Cheers to science!
